WebAssembly CSP Proposal

script-src: 'sha...' at some point will apply to wasm too
if that doesn't work: 'wasm-unsafe-eval' (used like unsafe-eval) to allow all wasm.

sodium-browserify-tweetnaclI is the sodium impl without wasm.
sodium-browserify uses the above as default and tries to upgrade to wasm

to avoid error messages when downgrading from native and from wasm to js impl of crypto stuff, we could make ssb-keys (and others) use tweetnacl instead of chloride. Would be interesting to see if there is any performance degration. Could be done with swapify in the webapp's package.json.
